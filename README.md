Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
	A lot of money is invested in crowdfunding campaigns
	Most are successful
	The most popular category for crowdfunding is theater, and plays are the most popular subcategory

What are some limitations of this dataset?
	We don’t get a sense of when or why campaigns gain or lose speed
	There are many outliers in the data

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
	Could create a histogram of the amounts each outcome type were able to raise to see if each subtype leans toward a particular amount raised

Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.
	Median better summarizes the data as successful and failed campaigns are both heavily right-skewed in terms of amount pledged. So, we’d get a better sense of the typical amount of money pledged to these campaigns by looking at the middle amount pledged as opposed to the average which would be heavily affected by the high-valued outliers.

Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
	There is not that much more variability with successful campaigns, though failed campaigns have smaller variability. This could be attributed to overall smaller amounts of pledges and amounts pledged that lead to the failure of those campaigns. Otherwise, the fact that their variability isn’t so extreme can be attributed to the fact that they’re likely to undergo similar experiences in crowdfunding in terms of general amounts pledged.
